Hi! I'm Guoran, feel free to call me **Future**. I read too many of Asimov's robot stories since I was young, which led me down the path of AI research. I'm generally interested in the following topics:


- **Generative models as world simulators**
    - conditioned on multimodal data like agent action, previous states, etc.
    - modelling 2D camera view or 3D space
- **Reinforcement Learning & Robotics with World Models**
    - learn world models, then learn from world models
    - sim2real through world models
- **Large foundation models**
    - Can we implement the above ideas in general-purpose large foundation models?

I'm still in the stage of reading papers and learning, so expect this list to be frequently updated (likely becoming more specific).
